# K-Means Clustering on Cricket Dataset

## Project Overview

This project applies K-Means clustering on a cricket players dataset to explore and group players based on their performance statistics. The dataset includes metrics like career span, matches, innings, runs, highest scores, batting averages, strike rates, and centuries.

## Dataset

The dataset contains detailed statistics for 79 international cricket players from various countries and eras.

## Objective

* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on player performance data
* Use K-Means clustering to identify patterns and player groupings
* Gain insights into different types of cricket players based on their career stats

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
* Scikit-learn (for K-Means clustering)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook/script for EDA and clustering

## Results

The clustering reveals meaningful groups of players categorized by performance metrics such as batting average and strike rate.
